  <title>Möbius function</title>
  
  <theorem>
  <statement>
  The following arithmetic functions are all equal:
  <ol>
  <li><m>\mu_1</m> defined in terms of factorization:
  	<men> \mu_1(n) = \begin{cases}
  		1 \amp \text{if } n = 1 \\
  		(-1)^k \amp \text{if } n = p_1 p_2 \dotsm p_k \\
  		0 \amp \text{if some } p^2 \mid n
  		\end{cases}
		</men>
	</li>
	<li><m>\mu_2</m> defined in terms of coefficients of a product:
		For any <m>n</m> we define <m>\mu_2</m> by
		<men> \prod_{p \mid n} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p^s} \right) = \sum_{d \mid n} \frac{\mu_2(d)}{d^s} </men>.
		Here the product is over all primes <m>p</m> that divide <m>n</m>,
		while the sum is over all (positive) divisors of <m>n</m>.
		The symbol <m>s</m> is a formal variable; alternatively we can interpret
		this as saying that the two sides of the equation are equal for all
		complex numbers <m>s</m>.
		(We follow normal exponent rules, <m>1^s = 1</m> and <m>a^s b^s = (ab)^s</m>.)
		We assert that this function <m>\mu_2</m> is well-defined in the sense
		that if <m>d \mid n</m> and <m>d \mid n'</m>, then <m>\frac{1}{d^s}</m> has
		the same coefficient whether the product is taken over the primes that
		divide <m>n</m>, or primes that divide <m>n'</m>.
		In fact <m>\mu_2(d)</m> is the coefficient of <m>\frac{1}{d^s}</m>
		in the infinite product <m>\prod_p \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p^s} \right)</m>
		over all primes (this is a formal product in the sense that we don't worry
		about whether it converges).
	</li>
	<li><m>\mu_3</m> defined recursively: We define <m>\mu_3(1) = 1</m>
		and for <m>n \gt 1</m>, we define <m>\mu_3(n)</m> by setting
		<m>\sum_{d \mid n} \mu_3(d) = 0</m>.
	</li>
	<li><m>\mu_4</m> defined as the Dirichlet inverse of the arithmetic function
		<m>1(n) = 1</m> for all <m>n</m>.
	</li>
	</ol>
	That is, for all <m>n</m>, <m>\mu_1(n) = \mu_2(n) = \mu_3(n) = \mu_4(n)</m>.
	</statement>
	</theorem>

	<example>
	<p>
	For example,
	<men>
		\prod_{p \mid 6} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p^s} \right)
		= \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2^s} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{3^s} \right)
		= 1 - \frac{1}{2^s} - \frac{1}{3^s} + \frac{1}{6^s}
	</men>.
	This shows that <m>\mu_2(1) = 1</m>, <m>\mu_2(2) = -1</m>,
	<m>\mu_2(3) = -1</m>, and <m>\mu_2(6) = 1</m>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Likewise,
	<men>
		\prod_{p \mid 4} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p^s} \right)
		= 1 - \frac{1}{2^s}
		= 1 - \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{0}{4^s}
	</men>.
	This gives <m>\mu_2(2) = -1</m>, agreeing with the result when the product
	was taken over primes <m>p \mid 6</m> instead of <m>p \mid 4</m>.
	In addition we see that <m>\mu_2(4) = 0</m>.
	</p>

	</example>
	
	<proof>
	<p>
	The recursive definition of <m>\mu_3</m> means precisely that
	<m>\mu_3 * 1 = e</m>.
	Therefore <m>\mu_3</m> is the Dirichlet inverse of <m>1</m>,
	so <m>\mu_3 = \mu_4</m>.
	(Note: Dirichlet inverses are unique: if <m>f * g_1 = f * g_2 = e</m>,
	then <m>g_1 = g_2</m> (why?).)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Suppose <m>d \mid n</m>, <m>d \gt 1</m>,
	and <m>d = p_1^{a_1} \dotsm p_k^{a_k}</m>
	where the <m>p_i</m> are distinct primes and each <m>a_i \geq 1</m>.
	First, each <m>p_i</m> divides <m>n</m> as well,
	so the product in the definition of <m>\mu_2</m> includes all of the primes
	<m>p_i</m> appearing in the prime factorization of <m>d</m>.
	If any <m>p_i^2 \mid d</m> then <m>\mu_2(d) = 0</m>,
	since the product only includes one factor of <m>1/p_i^s</m>;
	there is no <m>1/(p_i^2)^s</m>.
	(Here is where the formal variable <m>s</m> plays a role:
	without it, we could have <m>1/p_i = p_i / p_i^2</m>,
	and the sum could be rewritten to include a term with denominator <m>p_i^s</m>.
	With the <m>s</m> however, we have <m>1/p_i^s = p_i^s / (p_i^2)^s</m>,
	and we are requiring that the numerators only involve <m>\mu_2(d)</m>'s,
	without any <m>s</m>.)
	Otherwise, if each <m>a_i = 1</m>, so <m>d = p_1 p_2 \dotsm p_k</m>,
	then
	<men> \frac{\mu_2(d)}{d^s} = \frac{-1}{p_1^s} \frac{-1}{p_2^s} \dotsm \frac{-1}{p_k^s}
		= \frac{(-1)^k}{(p_1 \dotsm p_k)^s} </men>.
	This shows that in this case <m>\mu_2(d) = (-1)^k</m>.
	Finally for <m>d = 1</m> we have <m>\mu_2(1) = 1</m>
	because the term of the product with denominator <m>1^s = 1</m>
	is given by multiplying <m>1</m> for each prime <m>p \mid n</m>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This shows that <m>\mu_2(d) = \mu_1(d)</m> for all <m>d \mid n</m>.
	In particular, <m>\mu_2(d)</m> doesn't actually depend on which multiple
	<m>n</m> of <m>d</m> is used.
	Therefore <m>\mu_2 = \mu_1</m>.
	The fact that we can take the infinite product follows from the observation
	that including factors <m>1 - \frac{1}{p^s}</m> where <m>p \gt d</m>
	has no effect on the coefficient of <m>\frac{1}{d^s}</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	(proof that <m>\mu_2 = \mu_3</m>)

	<definition>
	The function <m>\mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3=\mu_4</m> defined in the above theorem
	is called the <term>Möbius function</term>
	and we henceforth denote it by <m>\mu</m>.
