  <title>Multiplicative functions</title>
  
  <definition>
  An arithmetic function <m>f</m> is <term>multiplicative</term>
  when it satisfies:
  <ol>
  <li> <m>f</m> is not identically zero, and </li>
  <li> if <m>(m,n) = 1</m> then <m>f(mn) = f(m)f(n)</m>. </li>
  </ol>
  It is <term>completely multiplicative</term>
  when it is not identically zero, and satisfies:
  for all <m>m,n</m>, <m>f(mn) = f(m)f(n)</m>.
  </definition>
  
  <remark>
  <p> Crisman allowed the identically zero function to be considered
  multiplicative. That forces a lot of statements to say
  <lq/>if <m>f</m> is multiplicative and not identically zero, then...<rq/>. </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
  We saw that <m>\phi</m> is multiplicative. However it is not
  completely multiplicative: <m>\phi(p^2) \neq \phi(p)^2</m>.
  </p>

  <p> The MÃ¶bius function is multiplicative, but not completely
  multiplicative, since <m>\mu(p) = -1</m> but <m>\mu(p^2) = 0</m>.
  The Liouville function
  <m>\lambda(p_1^{a_1} \dotsm p_k^{a_k}) = (-1)^{a_1+\dotsb+a_k}</m>
  is completely multiplicative. </p>
  
  <p> Observe that for a multiplicative (or completely multiplicative)
  function <m>f</m> we must have <m>f(1) = 1</m>.
  Indeed, <m>f(1) = f(1 \cdot 1) = f(1)^2</m>, and the only solutions
  are <m>f(1) = 1</m> or <m>0</m>.
  However if <m>f(1)=0</m> (and still assuming <m>f</m> is
  multiplicative or completely multiplicative)
  then <m>f(n)=0</m> for all <m>n</m>, because
  <m>f(n) = f(1 \cdot n) = f(1)f(n) = 0</m>,
  using that <m>(1,n) = 1</m>.
  That is, if <m>f</m> has the multiplicative property and
  <m>f(1)=0</m>, then <m>f</m> is identically zero.
  Since we require <lq/>multiplicative<rq/> functions to not be
  identically zero, then they must have <m>f(1) \neq 0</m>.
  So it must be <m>f(1)=1</m>. </p>
  
  <p>
  A completely multiplicative function <m>f</m> is entirely determined
  by its values at primes.
  That is, the values <m>f(p)</m> for <m>p</m> prime are enough
  to determine <m>f(n)</m> for all <m>n \geq 1</m>.
  Indeed, for <m>n = p_1^{a_1} \dotsm p_k^{a_k}</m>
  we must have <m>f(n) = f(p_1)^{a_1} \dotsm f(p_k)^{a_k}</m>. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  A multiplicative function <m>f</m> is entirely determined
  by its values at powers of primes, because
  <m>f(p_1^{a_1} \dotsc p_k^{a_k}) = \prod f(p_i^{a_i})</m>.
  </p>
  
  <p> The functions <m>1</m>, <m>N</m>, and <m>e</m>
  are completely multiplicative.
  The functions <m>\sigma_s</m> are multiplicative,
  but not completely multiplicative.
  (For example <m>\sigma_s(2)=1+2^s</m>, but
  <m>\sigma_s(4)=1+2^s+4^s \neq \sigma_s(2)^s</m>.)
  The proof that <m>\sigma_s</m> are multiplicative will be given
  in the next section, as part of a more general statement
  about Dirichlet products of multiplicative functions. </p>
