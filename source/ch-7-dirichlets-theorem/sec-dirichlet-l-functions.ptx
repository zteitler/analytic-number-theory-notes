  <title>Dirichlet L-functions</title>

  <definition>
  Let <m>q</m> be a positive integer and <m>\chi</m>
  a Dirichlet character modulo <m>q</m>.
  We define
  <men>
    L(\chi,s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi(n)}{n^s}
  </men>,
  called the <term>Dirichlet <m>L</m>-function</term>
  associated to <m>\chi</m>.
  Here <m>s</m> is a complex variable; <m>L(\chi,s)</m>
  is a function defined on the subset of <m>\bbC</m>
  where this series converges, with values in <m>\bbC</m>.
  </definition>
  
  <p>
  When we think of <m>s</m> as a complex number, we can write
  <m>s = \sigma + it</m>, where <m>\sigma</m> is the real part of <m>s</m>
  and <m>t</m> is the imaginary part.
  However for the proof of Dirichlet's theorem we will only
  deal with real values of <m>s</m>, so we will mostly just use
  the letter <m>s</m>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The series converges absolutely if <m>s</m> has real part
  strictly greater than <m>1</m>, i.e., if <m>\sigma \gt 1</m>.
  To see this, recall that every value <m>\chi(n)</m> is either
  a root of unity, or else zero.
  Then,
  <men>
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left| \frac{\chi(n)}{n^s} \right|
    \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^\sigma}
  </men>.
  We know that this series converges if <m>\sigma \gt 1</m>,
  and diverges if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>, by the theory of <m>p</m>-series.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  However we will also be interested in Dirichlet <m>L</m>-functions
  when <m>0 \lt \sigma \leq 1</m>.
  Now the series fails to converge absolutely, but it might still
  converge conditionally.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Having said that, if the character <m>\chi=\chi_0</m> is the principal character,
  then it's easy to see that <m>\sum \chi_0(n)/n^s</m> diverges to <m>\infty</m>
  if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>.
  It is not exactly a <m>p</m>-series because <m>\chi_0(n) = 0</m>
  when <m>(n,q) \gt 1</m>.
  However, for each arithmetic sequence corresponding to a residue class
  modulo <m>q</m>, we can show that the sum diverges,
  via a comparison with a <m>p</m>-series.
  For example,
  <me>
    \sum_{n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}} \left|\frac{1}{n^s}\right|
    = \frac{1}{2^\sigma} + \frac{1}{7^\sigma} + \frac{1}{12^\sigma} + \dotsb
    \gt \frac{1}{5^\sigma} + \frac{1}{10^\sigma} + \frac{1}{15^\sigma} + \dotsb
    = \frac{1}{5^\sigma} \left( \frac{1}{1^\sigma} + \frac{1}{2^\sigma} + \frac{1}{3^\sigma} + \dotsb \right)
  </me>,
  where the last sum is a normal <m>p</m>-series,
  so it diverges if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  So, the Dirichlet <m>L</m>-series for the principal character
  diverges if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>,
  and for nonprincipal characters, it does not converge absolutely
  if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>.
  The only thing left to settle is whether the series for a nonprincipal
  character converges conditionally.
  And it turns out that it does.
  </p>
