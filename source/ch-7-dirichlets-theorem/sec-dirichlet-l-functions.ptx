  <title>Dirichlet L-functions</title>

  <definition>
  Let <m>q</m> be a positive integer and <m>\chi</m>
  a Dirichlet character modulo <m>q</m>.
  We define
  <men>
    L(\chi,s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi(n)}{n^s}
  </men>,
  called the <term>Dirichlet <m>L</m>-function</term>
  associated to <m>\chi</m>.
  Here <m>s</m> is a complex variable; <m>L(\chi,s)</m>
  is a function defined on the subset of <m>\bbC</m>
  where this series converges, with values in <m>\bbC</m>.
  </definition>
  
  <p>
  When we think of <m>s</m> as a complex number, we can write
  <m>s = \sigma + it</m>, where <m>\sigma</m> is the real part of <m>s</m>
  and <m>t</m> is the imaginary part.
  However for the proof of Dirichlet's theorem we will only
  deal with real values of <m>s</m>, so we will mostly just use
  the letter <m>s</m>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The series converges absolutely if <m>s</m> has real part
  strictly greater than <m>1</m>, i.e., if <m>\sigma \gt 1</m>.
  To see this, recall that every value <m>\chi(n)</m> is either
  a root of unity, or else zero.
  Then,
  <men>
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left| \frac{\chi(n)}{n^s} \right|
    \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^\sigma}
  </men>.
  We know that this series converges if <m>\sigma \gt 1</m>,
  and diverges if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>, by the theory of <m>p</m>-series.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  However we will also be interested in Dirichlet <m>L</m>-functions
  when <m>0 \lt \sigma \leq 1</m>.
  Now the series fails to converge absolutely, but it might still
  converge conditionally.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Having said that, if the character <m>\chi=\chi_0</m> is the principal character,
  then it's easy to see that <m>\sum \chi_0(n)/n^s</m> diverges to <m>\infty</m>
  if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>.
  It is not exactly a <m>p</m>-series because <m>\chi_0(n) = 0</m>
  when <m>(n,q) \gt 1</m>.
  However, for each arithmetic sequence corresponding to a residue class
  modulo <m>q</m>, we can show that the sum diverges,
  via a comparison with a <m>p</m>-series.
  For example,
  <me>
    \sum_{n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}} \left|\frac{1}{n^s}\right|
    = \frac{1}{2^\sigma} + \frac{1}{7^\sigma} + \frac{1}{12^\sigma} + \dotsb
    \gt \frac{1}{5^\sigma} + \frac{1}{10^\sigma} + \frac{1}{15^\sigma} + \dotsb
    = \frac{1}{5^\sigma} \left( \frac{1}{1^\sigma} + \frac{1}{2^\sigma} + \frac{1}{3^\sigma} + \dotsb \right)
  </me>,
  where the last sum is a normal <m>p</m>-series,
  so it diverges if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  So, the Dirichlet <m>L</m>-series for the principal character
  diverges if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>,
  and for nonprincipal characters, it does not converge absolutely
  if <m>\sigma \leq 1</m>.
  The only thing left to settle is whether the series for a nonprincipal
  character converges conditionally.
  And it turns out that it does.
  </p>
  
  <theorem>
  <statement>
  Let <m>\chi</m> be a nonprincipal Dirichlet character <m>\mod q</m>
  and let <m>f</m> be a positive function that has a continuous
  negative derivative.
  Then
  <men>
    \sum_{x \lt n \leq y} \chi(n) f(n) = O(f(x))
  </men>.
  In addition, if <m>f(x) \to 0</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>,
  then the series <m>\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \chi(n) f(n)</m>
  converges and we have
  <men>
    \sum_{n \leq x} \chi(n) f(n) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \chi(n) f(n) + O(f(x))
  </men>.
  </statement>
  
  <proof>
  <p>
  We will use Riemann-Stieltjes integration and integration by parts,
  as we have done before
  (but it would be equivalent to use Abel summation).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Let <m>A(x) = \sum_{n \leq x} \chi(n)</m>.
  Since <m>\chi</m> is a nonprincipal character, we get that
  <m>\sum_{n=1}^q \chi(n) = 0</m> and in general <m>\sum_{n=1}^{kq} \chi(n) = 0</m>
  for every positive integer <m>k</m>.
  Therefore,
  <mdn>
  <mrow> |A(x)| \amp \leq \left| \sum_{n=1}^{kq} \chi(n) \right| + \sum_{kq+1 \leq n \lt x} |\chi(n)| </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp = \sum_{kq+1 \leq n \lt x, (n,q)=1} 1 </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp \leq \phi(q) </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp = O(1), </mrow>
  </mdn>
  and then by Riemann-Stieltjes integration and integration by parts
  (or by Abel summation),
  <mdn>
  <mrow> \sum_{x \lt n \leq y} \chi(n) f(n)
    \amp = \int_x^y f(t) dA(t) </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp = A(y)f(y) - A(x)f(x) - \int_x^y A(t) f'(t) dt </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp \ll f(y) + f(x) + \int_x^y |f'(t)| dt </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp \ll f(x) </mrow>
  </mdn>
  This is the first claim.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  (A remark: Above, we wrote <m>dA(t)</m> even though <m>A</m> is a
  complex-valued function.
  However, our previous discussion of Riemann-Stieltjes integration
  was only for real-valued functions.
  To deal with a complex-valued function,
  we could handle the real and imaginary parts of <m>A</m>
  separately, and just recombine them at the end.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Next, assume that <m>f(x) \to 0</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
  Since
  <me>
    \sum_{x \lt n \leq y} \chi(n) f(n) \ll f(x)
  </me>,
  or
  <me>
    \sum_{N \lt n \leq M} \chi(n) f(n) \ll f(N)
  </me>,
  then these partial sums for <m>x \lt n \leq y</m> or <m>N \lt n \leq M</m>
  go to zero as <m>x,N \to \infty</m>.
  Therefore the infinite series <m>\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \chi(n)f(n)</m>
  converges by the Cauchy criterion.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Finally, the partial sum for <m>n \leq x</m> is equal to to the sum
  of the whole series minus the sum of the tail <m>n \gt x</m>.
  And the sum of that tail is equal to the limit of the sum
  for <m>x \lt n \leq y</m> as <m>y \to \infty</m>.
  By the first claim, the tail is <m>O(f(x))</m> regardless of the
  value of <m>y</m>.
  </p>
  
  </proof>
  </theorem>
  
  <corollary>
  <statement>
  Let <m>\chi</m> be a nonprincipal Dirichlet character modulo <m>q</m>.
  Then for all <m>x \geq 2</m> we have
  <mdn>
  <mrow> \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\chi(n)}{n} \amp = L(1,\chi) + O\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) </mrow>
  <mrow> \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\chi(n)\log n}{n} \amp = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi(n) \log n}{n} + O\left(\frac{\log x}{x}\right) </mrow>
  <mrow> \sum_{n \leq x} \frac{\chi(n)}{\sqrt{n}} \amp = L\left(\frac{1}{2},\chi\right) + O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\right) </mrow>
  </mdn>
  </statement>
  <proof>
  The previous theorem with functions <m>\frac{1}{x}</m>,
  <m>\frac{\log x}{x}</m>, and <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}</m> respectively.
  </proof>
  </corollary>
  
  <p>
  A crucial step in the proof of Dirichlet's theorem
  is to prove that <m>L(1,\chi) \neq 0</m>.
  Very simply, the idea is to define a certain function <m>A(x)</m>,
  and to show that
  <ol>
  <li> <m>A(x) \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m> (<m>A(x)</m> is unbounded), but </li>
  <li> <m>A(x)</m> is equal to <m>L(1,\chi)</m> times some unbounded function, plus <m>O(1)</m>. </li>
  </ol>
  The point is that if <m>L(1,\chi)=0</m> then <m>A(x)=O(1)</m>,
  a contradiction.
  Specifically, this argument works for real-valued nonprincipal characters;
  we will give a separate argument for non-real nonprincipal characters.
  We postpone the details.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Very, very simply put, the reason we care that <m>L(1,\chi)</m>
  is nonzero is that we will show that
  <m>L(1,\chi)</m> times a certain sum is bounded,
  and then, as long as <m>L(1,\chi) \neq 0</m>, we can
  deduce that the sum itself is bounded.
  </p>
