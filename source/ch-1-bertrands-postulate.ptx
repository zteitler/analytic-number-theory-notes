  <title>Bertrand's Postulate</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Bertrand's postulate asserts that for every <m>n \geq 1</m>
    there is a prime <m>p</m> such that <m>n \lt p \leq 2n</m>.
    Our presentation mostly follows notes by David Galvin
    <xref ref="biblio-galvin-bertrand" />. </p>
    
    <p>
    This statement was conjectured in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand,
    who verified it for <m>n \lt 3 \cdot 10^6</m>.
    In 1850, Tchebychev proved it, using analysis.
    In 1919, Ramanujan gave a shorter proof, still using analysis.
    In 1932, in one of his first publications (perhaps his very first),
    Erdős gave an <lq/>elementary<rq/> proof.
    We will show Erdős's proof, and then a fun corollary.
