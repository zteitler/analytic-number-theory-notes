  <title>Chebyshev's Estimates</title>
 
 <p>
 Chebyshev gave the first concrete results toward proving the Prime Number Theorem
 (which at that time was a conjecture of Legendre and Gauss).
 </p>
 
 <theorem>
 <title>Chebyshev's estimate</title>
 <statement>
 We have <m>\psi(x) \asymp x</m>.
 In fact, <m>\psi(x) \asymp x</m> uniformly for <m> x \geq 2</m>.
 More explicitly,
 <m>\psi(x) \lt \frac{3}{2} x</m> for all <m>x \gt 0</m>
 and <m>\psi(x) \gt \frac{2}{3} x</m> for all <m>x \geq 7</m>.
 </statement>
 </theorem>

 <remark>
 Recall that <m>f \asymp g</m> means <m>f = O(g)</m> and <m>g = O(f)</m>.
 That is, there are constants <m>C,D</m> such that
 <m>f(x) \leq C g(x)</m> and <m>g(x) \leq D f(x)</m>
 for all sufficiently large <m>x</m>.
 And <m>f \asymp g</m> uniformly for <m>x \geq x_0</m>
 means this holds for all <m>x \geq x_0</m>.
 </remark>
 
 <corollary>
 <statement>
 <m>\theta(x) \asymp x</m> and <m>\pi(x) \asymp \frac{x}{\log x}</m>.
 Explicitly, <m>\theta(x) \leq (\log 4)x</m> for <m>x \geq 1</m>
 and <m>\theta(x) \gt \frac{x}{12}</m> for all <m>x \geq 2</m>;
 <m>\pi(x) \gt \frac{3 \log 2}{8} \frac{x}{\log x}</m> for all <m>x \geq 2</m>,
 and <m>\pi(x) \lt \frac{(6 \log 2) x}{\log x}</m> for all <m>x \geq 2</m>.
 </statement>
 </corollary>
 
 <remark>
 <p>
 <m>\frac{3 \log 2}{8} = 0.2599301927\dotsc</m>,
 <m>6 \log 2 = 4.1588830834\dotsc</m>.
 </p>
 </remark>
 
 <p>
 The proofs are a bit long and we won't go over them in class.
 (An exception is the proof that <m>\theta(x) \leq (\log 4)x</m>,
 which seems to be short and elementary, and very similar to the proof
 given in class of the Bertrand Postulate).
