  <title>Dirichlet's Hyperbola Method</title>
  
  <introduction>
	We have seen that <m>\sum_{n \leq x} d(n) = x \log x + O(x)</m>.
	Here we will seek an improvement:
	replacing the <m>O(x)</m> term with a concrete linear function,
	specifically <m>(2 \gamma - 1)x + O(\sqrt{x})</m>
	where <m>\gamma</m> is the <em>Euler-Mascheroni</em> constant.

  <title>Euler-Mascheroni constant</title>
  
  <p>
  For integer <m>b \gt 1</m> we have the estimate
  <me>
    \frac{1}{b} \leq \sum_{n = 1}^b \frac{1}{n} - \int_1^b \frac{1}{t} dt \leq 1
  </me>.
  The difference is increasing as a function of <m>b</m>,
  because if we think of the sum as a left-hand rule Riemann sum,
  then each time <m>b</m> increases, we are adding a <lq/>triangle<rq/>
  to the difference.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Since the difference is increasing and bounded, it converges to a limit.
  This limit is called the <em>Euler-Mascheroni constant</em>,
  denoted <m>\gamma</m> because of connections with the gamma function.
  Numerically,
  <me> \gamma = 0.577215664901532\dotsc </me>
  It is an open question whether <m>\gamma</m> is rational or irrational
  (and if it is irrational, whether it is algebraic or transcendental).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  In general,
  <men>
    \sum_{d \leq x} \frac{1}{d} = \log x + \gamma + O(\frac{1}{x})
  </men>.
  (Why?)

  <title>Hyperbola method</title>
  
  <p>
  Observe:
  <men> \sum_{n \leq x} d(n)  = \sum_{dk \leq x} 1 = \#\{(d,k) \colon d k \leq x \} </men>,
  which means the sum we are interested in is the number of lattice points
  on or under the hyperbola <m>dk = x</m>.
  </p>
  
  <remark>
  <p>
  Using more common variable names, we might consider the hyperbola
  <m>xy = c</m> (say), or in other words <m>y = \frac{c}{x}</m>.
  If we substitute <m>x = (x' - y')/\sqrt{2}</m>, <m>y = (x' + y')/\sqrt{2}</m>,
  then the hyperbola is transformed to
  <m>x'^2 - y'^2 = 2c</m>, a more common form of a hyperbola.
  And this substitution is simply a rotation by <m>45</m> degrees.
  </p>
  </remark>
  
  <p>
  Our previous estimate came from counting the lattice points
  on each column with horizontal coordinate <m>d</m>, for each <m>d \leq x</m>:
  there are <m>\left\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right\rfloor</m> lattice points
  in that column, which is approximately equal to <m>x/d</m>
  with <m>O(1)</m> error;
  then summing <m>x/d</m> is approximated by an integral.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  We can try to improve this idea by breaking the area
  under the hyperbola into three (overlapping) regions:
  the region <m>d \leq \sqrt{x}</m>, the region <m>k \leq \sqrt{x}</m>,
  and the region <m>d,k \leq \sqrt{x}</m>.
  The first region is the <lq/>left part<rq/>
  of the area, consisting of the <lq/>arm<rq/> pointing upwards
  plus the square under that arm.
  The second region is the <lq/>right part<rq/>,
  and the third region is the square between the two arms
  (with the two arms attached to its right and top sides).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The number of lattice points in the square is simply
  <men>
    \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor^2 = (\sqrt{x} + O(1))^2 = x + O(\sqrt{x})
  </men>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The number of points in the left part is
  <md>
  <mrow> \sum_{d \leq \sqrt{x}} \left\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right\rfloor
    \amp = \sum_{d \leq \sqrt{x}} (\frac{x}{d} + O(1)) </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp = x \sum_{d \leq \sqrt{x}} \frac{1}{d} + O(\sqrt{x}) </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp  = x (\log \sqrt{x} + \gamma + O(1/\sqrt{x}) ) + O(\sqrt{x}) </mrow>
  <mrow> \amp = x \log \sqrt{x} + \gamma x + O(\sqrt{x}) </mrow>
  </md>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Likewise the number of lattice points in the right part is
  by symmetry the same.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  So, the total number of lattice points is
  <men>
    2(x \log \sqrt{x} + \gamma x + O(\sqrt{x})) - (x + O(\sqrt{x}))
    = x \log x + (2\gamma - 1) x + O(\sqrt{x})
  </men>.
  </p>
  
  <remark>
  <p>
  Write
  <me>
    \sum_{n \leq x} d(n) = x \log x + (2 \gamma - 1)x + \Delta(x)
  </me>.
  We have seen that <m>\Delta(x) = O(x^{1/2})</m>.
  It has been shown that <m>\Delta(x) = O(x^{1/3})</m>;
  on the other hand, <m>\Delta(x)</m> is not
  <m>O(x^{1/4})</m>.
  It is an open problem to find the infimum of <m>p</m>
  such that <m>\Delta(x)</m> is <m>O(x^p)</m>.
